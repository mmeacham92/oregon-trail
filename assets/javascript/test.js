// Stretch Goals
// Add the wagons and the travelers to the DOM.
// Display relevent information in the DOM about the wagons and traveler â€“ for example: travelers name/food/isHealthy, and/or Wagon's passengers/capacity.
// Add buttons to your classes â€“ for example: make a traveler eat, add a traveler to a wagon, check if a wagon should quarantine, etc.
// Add a button to create a new traveler based on a name the user inputs.
// Add animations simulating travel, etc.
// Generally just make your game feel more like the original Oregon Trail.
